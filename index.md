I am a PhD student at the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. I work on data-efficient machine translation through the induction of latent structure in translation data. My research is part of the European [GoURMET](http://gourmet-project.eu/) project. My thesis adviser is [dr. Wilker Ferreira Aziz](http://wilkeraziz.github.io/).

You can find my CV [here](/assets/files/CV.pdf).

### News
* We developed a [notebook](https://github.com/probabll/dgm4nlp/blob/solutions/notebooks/sentencevae/SentVAE_Solutions.ipynb) describing and implementing a sentence VAE ([Bowman et. al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349)) in PyTorch.
* The European [GoURMET](http://gourmet-project.eu/) project, and with that my PhD, started!
* We released a pre-print of our research on a joint deep generative model for neural machine translation. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10564) and [code](https://github.com/Roxot/AEVNMT).
