I am a second-year master student in the [Totem Database group](totemdb.whu.edu.cn) of School of Computer Science, Wuhan University. My superviser is Zhiyong Peng. 

You can find my CV [here](/assets/files/CV.pdf).

### News
* Our Auto-Encoding Variational Neural Machine Translation was accepted as a long paper at RepL4NLP.
* We developed a [notebook](https://github.com/probabll/dgm4nlp/blob/solutions/notebooks/sentencevae/SentVAE_Solutions.ipynb) describing and implementing a sentence VAE ([Bowman et. al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349)) in PyTorch.
* The European [GoURMET](http://gourmet-project.eu/) project, and with that my PhD, started!
* We released a pre-print of our research on a joint deep generative model for neural machine translation. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10564) and [code](https://github.com/Roxot/AEVNMT).
